### About The Project

I don't have the actual design file so the layout is not pixel-perfect. Implementation focuses on:

- Clean and modern CSS
- Good accessibility practices
- Keyboard-friendly interactions

## 🚀 Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yusufardapeker/time-tracking-dashboard.git
cd time-tracking-dashboard
```

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you may enable:

- Live Server → to preview the project

- Live Sass Compiler (by Glenn Marks) → to compile style.scss

## 📘 Usage

Use the timeframe buttons (e.g., Daily, Weekly, Monthly) to update the displayed results.
